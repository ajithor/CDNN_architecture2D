# CDNN_architecture2D
Python code to check architecture for convolving and pooling of images pixels in arrays.
Ever have gone through all the trouble to design an architecture of Covolutional Deep Nueral Network ?--Always!
So this python script just prints the supposed image pixel sizes (2D initially);
based on inputs like strides, filtersize, zeropadding for convolutional layers and Pooling layers.

Currently just supports the first two Dimensions. Can be modified to accomodate higher dimension, number of filters at each layer, etc.
